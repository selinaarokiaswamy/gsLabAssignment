A Python Flask web service which has REST APIs implemented for employee CRUD operations create employee, update employee, view employee, delete employee and view all employees list. All the employee records should be maintained in an sqlite database. Use flask-sqlalchemy as the ORM for connectivity between your flask server and database. The APIs takes JSON as input (Content-type: application/json) and also return a 200 OK response for successful CRUD operations and do the DB operations accordingly. Run the Flask application in multithreaded mode using Gunicorn.
